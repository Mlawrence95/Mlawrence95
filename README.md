# About me

Hi there! I'm a data scientist/machine learning engineer at Illumina, a giant in DNA sequencing technology. I have extensive experience building software supporting machine learning applications for both real-time and batched processes, with recent experience in both NLP and time series data. Before that, I studied physics at UC Berkeley, where I spent my extra time as a data science TA.

My interests are primarily in MLOps work - taking code from researchers, translating it into scalable, tested, maintainable software, with as much automation as possible.
