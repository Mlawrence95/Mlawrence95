# About me

Hi there! I'm a data scientist/machine learning engineer at Illumina. I build machine learning applications for both real-time and batched processes, with recent experience in NLP and time series data. Before that, I studied physics at UC Berkeley, where I was a data science TA.

My interests are primarily in MLOps work - taking code from researchers, translating it into scalable, tested, maintainable software, with as much automation as possible.
